# Mixture of Dirichlet Process priors for combining multiple sub-spatial models
This repository contains R codes of the mixture of Dirichlet processes for combined analysis of multiple related geostatistical datasets. The developed model probabilistically combines multiple sub-spatial models through a probabilistic pathway. The findings show that there is a high possibility of having a better inferential and predictive model when sub-spatial models are analyzed in a single modeling framework compared to individual (single) analysis of multiple related data.
