# Mixture of Dirichlet Process priors for combining multiple sub-spatial models
This repository contains R codes of the mixture of Dirichlet process priors for combined analysis of multiple related geostatistical datasets. The developed model probabilistically combines multiple sub-spatial models through a probabilistic pathway. The model leads to a non-stationary and non-Gaussian spatial process. The findings from simulation study shows an advantage over independent and exchangible Dirichlet process priors.
